@snapend

Note:

- Everything is on the internet
- Courses great for beginner, not for pros
- Books can be obsolete
- How-tos can be of shit quality
- Bootcamp you already know
- Streaming error troubleshooting is the real deal

### Survivor bias
@snapend

@snap[west span-45]
@ul[list-bullets-black text-08](false)
- Only success stories get proper visibility
- Failure is good
- Everyone can code, but not everyone is fit for the job

Note:

- Succ. stories unbelivable but possibly true
- We could have less hype if more fail stories

@snapend

@snap[west span-45 text-white]

### Imposter syndrome
@snapend

@snap[west span-45]
Are you feeling that:
@ul[list-bullets-black text-08](false)
- Everyone is smarter than you?
- You faked your way here?
- You're about to get exposed as a phony?

@snapend

Note:

- My old friend
- Test: Have you answered 'YES' to the questions?
- Diagnosis is: Imposter Syndrome
- Imposter syndrome is when you show up for work after a month and still feel like you didn't pass the interview.
- I have it at this moment
- Prescription: make an achievements list

- If you're like Jon Snow and know nothing then freecodecamp is the website for you
- They have answers for every interview question
- Not sure which book first but YDKJS should be your second
- Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski. Over 100 episodes. Best. Podcast. Ever. 
- Since hiring is broken, then CW is good for challenges
- CS50 is free CS course from Harvard
